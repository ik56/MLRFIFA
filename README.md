## MLRFIFA
The goal of this Multiple Linear Regression Analysis is to asses whether the variables wage, release clause, pace, shooting, passing, and defending impact the value of player in the game. 
# Description 
FIFA 21 is a soccer video game based on its real-life counterpart. In the game players can take 
advantage of a variety of in game modes including training sessions, king of the hill, volta football, career 
mode etc. For the analysis of this paper, the players being used in the manager mode will be at the center 
of the discussion. In the career mode, players can choose to be either a player or a manager. Based on the 
player’s choice, the game will simulate them from the perspective of the player or the manager, while 
giving the FIFA player control of all the in-game features. Playing FIFA in manager mode I would often 
run into the same issue, getting good players. The only two ways to get good players in the game is 
through scouts getting prospects from different sides of the world or buying players from the transfer 
market. With the transfer market being too much of a premium, the latter choice became the default 
option. With one problem addressed a new problem came to take its place. With an abundance of new 
prospective talent coming to my in-game club, the new question became “how do I make these guys 
good?” More specifically “what attributes can be used to increase the overall value (level) of the players 
that are being brought into the club?
